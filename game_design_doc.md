## Unnamed Farm Game

### Introduction

#### Game Summary

This will be a simple hex-tile based farm/city building game without turn-based restrictions.  The goal is to make your "town" output as many resources as possible while balancing population thresholds, food requirements of the population, and gold requirements for building and upkeep.  In its base form, it's a sandbox game without any specific goals.  I like games where it's "do thing, make number go up, get dopamine", so this kind of game would be right up my alley.

#### Inspiration

**Sid Meier's Civilization**: This provides the basis for the hex-based map design.  This allows more minute control over the world and the units themselves, over standard square tile design.  It will also make it easier to smooth generated worlds via Voronoi.

**Age of Empires**: Building placement on an open map, without enforced borders has been something I've wanted to see in a game for a while.  The buildings will be self-sufficient, and won't need to be connected directly to a city center.  (Note, I'm thinking long-term we might wanna implement a curve on how much of a resource is returned based on distance from the capital)

**Caesar 3**: Resource and worker management is important in any game city-building game with stakes, even if they're not high.  The player will be required to train workers and assign them to create resources.  There will be thresholds for how many workers are allowed at a time until the player has to add more housing, for example.

#### Player Experience

For the minimum project in scope with this game jam, the player will be able to create or load a game, set some basic options, and quit the game.  When creating a new game, a world will be procedurally generated, and the player will be placed into it with a couple workers and a town center.  From there they can begin building farms, houses, and mines to gain more resources.  Long-term there will be a base set of optional objectives assigned for the player to achieve during play, on map creation.  Additionally, long-term, I'd like the player to be able to convert farms to various types.  Increased resources available to the population may result in production increases, etc.

#### Platform

Currently, this will only be for PC, Linux, and Mac.  The game will be written in Python so anyone could grab a copy, install the requirements, and run the game.

#### Development Software

* Python 3.13 (Programming Language)
* PyGame (Game Engine)
* GIMP (Asset Creation)
* FL Studio (Audio Creation)
* PyInstaller (Packaging)

#### Genre

City-builder, single player, farming

#### Target Audience

The game will be marketed toward casual gamers.  Since there is no plan for multiplayer or any serious "stakes" to the player experience per map, I believe this will be a game for folks to fall asleep to.  

### Concept

#### Gameplay Loop

After a map is generated, the player is placed onto the map in a pseudorandom location, with two *Workers* adjacent to a *Town Center*.  The player will survey the area to see what access they have to farmlands tiles in order to produce *Food* in bulk to support their *Population*, which immediately begins consuming food.  Once they've assigned workers to their farms, there will be a surplus of food.  This allows them to train more Workers.  Purchasing buildings cost gold, so the player's next move would likely be to find some hills or mountains, which contain ore resources (currently only *Gold*).  The players construct Mines adjacent to these to harvest them.  These resources do not deplete and provide a fixed amount per minute.

** Important Mental Note **: Workers should be able to be reassigned easily.

For now, that's the core loop I'm going for.

#### Mechanics

* Each person consumes 1 food per minute.
* Each farm creates 2 food per minute, but costs 1 gold per minute to operate.
* Each mine creates 2 of that resource per minute, but costs 1 gold per minute to operate.
* After population is has reached its cap, workers may have to be reassigned to create a town hall in another location (or build Houses) to allow for new growth.
* Unassigned workers do not consume food.  This allows the player to reach a balance again to get back into the green before they start enabling resources again.

### Art and Design

This will be generated by me in GIMP for now.  I'll be generating some basic tiles for the terrain, workers, farms, and mines for now.  Later, I'll add fancier edge-tiles and stuff to stylize the game better.  For now, I'll be using soft tones in GIMP to draw basic assets as best I can.  Granted, I'm not an artist, and I'll be doing this with a mouse.  Long-term, I'll be looking for anime-esque art for this game.  It's meant to be easy on the eyes.  

### Audio and Music

I will initially be using some free-use bgm for the game, which will require minimal mixing/production in any form.  However, I've already been doodling with a background theme for the game intro and main menu.  This is in FL Studio already, but it's not in a state (and will not be by the end of the jam) where I feel comfortable putting it into the game.  For sound effects, I may generate some of them myself from free use sounds, but many will be free use sounds for now.

### UI

There will a standard city-builder UI with a bar at the top which displays gold and food stores and IO (+ or - how many per minutex, I mean), plus current population and population threshold.  When a building or unit is select, a menu with appear in the bottom left which gives the options that can be take for that building or on that tile.  Hovering over a tile should display yields for the tile as well as the type.  There should be a rudimentary minimap as well.

### Controls

This is all mouse-driven for now.  Long-term I may add controller support.  If a method becomes possible, I'll also port this for Android, and will therefore need to add touch support.
